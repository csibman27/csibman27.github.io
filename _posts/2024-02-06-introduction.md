# Commercial Title: “Server Life Cycle Manager”
## Academic Title: A web application for Managing IT Equipment primarily in data center


## Project type: Standalone management web application


## Abstract
LCManager is a web application designed specifically for system administrators to efficiently handle the management and execution of server and software lifecycles. By addressing usual challenges faced in on-premises server rooms, this application offers viable solution to enhance operational efficiency. One of the key advantages of LCManager is its ability to provide administrators with a centralized view of all servers' lifecycle stages and ages. This feature offers invaluable visibility, ensuring that critical information is available and easily accessible. Moreover, LCManager introduces a catalog that enables administrators to identify crucial factors pertaining to server updates, disposals, and other necessary actions.
